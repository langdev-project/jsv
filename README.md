# THE JASTU-SEVENSI LANGUAGES #

THE JASTU-SEVENSI LANGUAGES get their title from the fact that they were initially developed for use in a story-project I was working on, codenamed `7C`.
*Highly* generative, they were my first attempt at a geographically- and culturally-independent language.
Initial development took place from 2009-2012; you can find lexicons from this period in [the !DEPRECIATED! folder](!DEPRECIATED!).

In 2015, the lexicons generated during this early development were combined into [JASTU-SEVENSI VIV](0009), and development began anew.

Documentation and back-development for SEVENSI and its ancestors takes place at <https://github.com/literallybenjam/7c/>.

##  Roadmap  ##

- !DEPRECIATED! : Base for THE JASTU-SEVENSI LANGUAGES
- VIV : Collection under common orthography and grammar
- CLASSICAL SEVENSI :
    - VIV : Regional variant
    - X : Grammatical standardization
    - XI : Phonological standardization
    - XII : Release-candidate

<!--  This really all belongs in 7c somewhere, but…

##  Orthographic history:  ##

1. Purely representational sketches are canonized into pictographs and ideograms.

2. Ideographic system expands; many symbols take on an alternate phonological meaning for use with grammatical words or affixes.

3. In the Philosophical Period, the alphabet is developed to allow military orders to be communicated to sometimes-illiterate troops. It does not gain widespread adoption outside of the military.

4. Post–Philosophical Period, the presence of the Classics and implementation of meritocratic structures result in a more widespread investment in literacy and accessibility. The alphabet is commonly used in casual writings but is still looked down upon by the elite.

5. New Nation declares the alphabet the official writing system and dismisses the ideographic system as archaic and a relic of the privileged elite. The Classics are translated into alphabetic characters for common consumption.

6. Many ideographic works are destroyed during the Dark Ages, making a complete reconstruction of ideographic Sevensi impossible.

7. Hangul is adopted as the official Sevensi alphabet, and many modern features such as spaces and punctuation marks are incorporated.
