# THE JASTU-SEVENSI LANGUAGES #

THE JASTU-SEVENSI LANGUAGES get their title from the fact that they were initially developed for use in a story-project I was working on, codenamed `7C`.
*Highly* generative, they were my first attempt at a geographically- and culturally-independent language.
Initial development took place from 2009-2012; you can find lexicons from this period in [the !DEPRECIATED! folder](!DEPRECIATED!).

In 2015, the lexicons generated during this early development were combined into [JASTU-SEVENSI VIV](0009), and development began anew.

##  Roadmap  ##

- !DEPRECIATED! : Base for THE JASTU-SEVENSI LANGUAGES
- VIV : Collection under common orthography and grammar
- CLASSICAL SEVENSI :
    - VIV : Regional variant
    - X : Grammatical standardization
    - XI : Phonological standardization
    - XII : Release-candidate
