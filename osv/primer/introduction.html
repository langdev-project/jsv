		<H4>Aim and Purpose</H4>

		<P>	<CITE>Classical Sevensi: A Primer</CITE> is a textbook for beginners in the study of <U>Classical Sevensi</U> as a written and spoken language.
			Completing the lessons hereïn will give students the knowledge they need to formulate and understand common expressions in the language, and will pave the way for more advanced study.
			This textbook is designed to be studied in an independent manner or with a companion.<SUP Id=aim.r1><A Href=#aim.n1>1</A></SUP>
			A working knowledge of <U>English</U> is required to read this text, as word definitions and grammar explanations are provided in that language.

		<FOOTER Id=aim.notes>

			<DL>

				<DT Id=aim.n1><A Href=#aim.r1>1</A></DT>
				<DD>	Due to the scarcity of both speakers and students of <U>Classical Sevensi</U>, formal classroom study is unlikely to be feasible.
					This text is thus aimed at more intimate environments.

		<SECTION Id=language.overview>

			<H5>Overview</H5>

			<P>	This textbook is an introduction to <U>Classical Sevensi</U>, a fictional language developed as part of <A Href=http://langdev.xyz/><U>the LANGDEV Project</U></A>.
				Development of the pre&hyphen;language from which <U>Classical Sevensi</U> would eventually descend began in <TIME>2009</TIME>, and development of the language proper first began in <TIME>2015</TIME>.

			<P>	More precisely, this textbook teaches <U>Classical Sevensi XII</U>, or <U>Late&hyphen;Classical Sevensi</U>, the form of the language under which the Sevensi literary tradition first began to flourish.<SUP Id=language.r1><A Href=#language.n1>1</A></SUP>
				This language developed from <U>Classical Sevensi XI</U>, or <U>Early&hyphen;Classical Sevensi</U>, which in turn developed from <U>Classical Sevensi X</U>, or <U>Pre&hyphen;Classical Sevensi</U>.
				<U>Classical Sevensi</U> is a member of the <U>Jastu&hyphen;Sevensi</U> language family, and references to these and other <U>Jastu&hyphen;Sevensi</U> languages (real or hypothesized) are made in the etymological notes included in the <A Href=Glossary/index.html><CITE>Glossary</CITE></A>.

			<P>	Although this textbook teaches a <I Class=So-Called>classical</I> language, it is aimed at a modern audiënce.
				Consequently, the <A Href=Lessons/index.html><CITE>Lessons</CITE></A> and <A Href=Glossary/index.html><CITE>Glossary</CITE></A> contain modern loanwords and coinages which should not generally be considered a part of the <U>Classical</U> lexicon proper.
				These are marked with a dagger symbol (<I><ABBR Title=loanword;&#x20;modern&#x20;coinage>†</ABBR></I>) in the glossary and definition lists.

		<SECTION Id=language.why>

			<H5>Why learn <U>Sevensi</U>?</H5>

			<P>	For a person without prior experience with <U>Sevensi</U> language or culture, it might seem odd that anyone would bother going through the hassle of learning it at all.
				Just like with natural languages, <U>Sevensi</U> has a unique history and culture which stands on its own merit and demands to be respected.
				Unlike natural languages, however, and somewhat uniquely among languages in general, <U>Sevensi</U>'s history is entirely <EM>fictional</EM>&mdash;and, consequently, open to endless reïmagining and reïnterpretation.
				While making up stories about the origins of <U>English</U> might get you in trouble with some crotchety old university professors, making up stories about <U>Sevensi</U> is not only allowed but <EM>encouraged</EM>&mdash;provided, of course, that no major cultural erasures happen in the process.

			<P>	There is, naturally, also room for academic interest in <U>Sevensi</U>, as it is relatively unique in many respects, with grammatical structures that developed along their own path divorced from those of the rest of the world.
				<U>Sevensi</U> was developed with the primary intent of being <EM>etymologically&hyphen;distinct</EM>, and this goal has extended beyond the construction of individual words and phrases and into the underlying structure of the language itself.

			<P>	The best reason to learn <U>Sevensi</U>, however, is for its own sake, because you find the language and history and culture fascinating and want to grow close to them on a more fundamental level.
				I urge all readers to examine the rest of this <CITE>Introduction</CITE>, and perhaps browse through one or two of the <A Href="Lessons/index.html"><CITE>Lessons</CITE></A>, and then decide for themselves whether or not a study of <U>Sevensi</U> is right for them.

		<SECTION Id=language.history>

			<H5>History and context</H5>

			<P>	Imagine a continent, roughly rectangular in shape, surrounded on all sides by ocean, and with an extensive archipelago extending southward from its western border.
				This is the setting in which the <U>Sevensi</U> language is said to have developed.
				It is a land of diverse geography, whose people find their living through both trade and agriculture, where nations and rulers have risen up, fragmented, and come to strength once again.
				Relatively cut&hyphen;off from the outside world, it has developed its own unique cultures and philosophies (far from monolithic), and embedded into its language is a unique way of viewing the world.

			<P>	What we know of early <u>Sevensi</u> culture is limited: vernacular stories that have been passed down through the ages, subtle references to past occurances in the <CITE>Classics</CITE>, remnants of older world&hyphen;views in the stories and legends of today.
				Most of the written documents from this time were lost; those that weren't are conveyed in a script which is no longer understood&mdash;and so we find ourselves tracing backwards from the present, attempting to reconstruct a long&hyphen;forgotten past.

			<P>	Although it is, in some ways, dangerous to attempt to draw too many parallels between the <U>Sevensi</U> continent and other locations in or beyond this world, such a practice can perhaps shed some light on the conditions in which early <U>Sevensi</U> culture might have been said to form.
				We can suppose, for example, that early <U>Sevensi</U> humans first began cultivating crops as a food source around 10,000 years ago, alongside the rest of the world.
				From linguistic data and basic geographical understanding, we can surmise that rice production was likely common in the Northern regions; maize cultivation is highly probable elsewhere.<SUP Id=language.r2><A Href=#language.n2>2</A></SUP>
				A turn to agriculture led to more permanent settlements and the development of new tools and storage materials—we can anticipate pottery and stone&hyphen;polishing as emergent in this period as well.

			<P>	<U>Sevensi</U> is the most successful of the <U>Jastu&hyphen;Sevensi</U> languages, which are hypothesized to descend from at least three distinct prehistoric cultures.
				The most principal of these, <U>Jastulae</U> <SPAN Lang=en-fonipa>[dʒeɪsˈtuːlej]</SPAN>, likely inhabited a central region on the continent, located near a river to facilitate agriculture, and expansive enough to be in contact with its neighbouring cultures.
				To the north, <U>Lrex</U> <SPAN Lang=en-fonipa>[ˈɛlɹɛks]</SPAN> culture thrived thru a combination of farming and herding; to the south, <U>Eho</U> <SPAN Lang=en-fonipa>[ˈiːhəʊ]</SPAN> culture cultivated crops and was heavily involved in fishing.
				And within each of these, numerous sub&hyphen;cultures doubtlessly developed and thrived.

			<P>	Our knowledge of these early cultures is highly limited, largely because of the lack of any records dating back to their existence.
				It is hypothesized that an early form of <U>Sevensi</U> logographic writing first developed within the <u>Jastulae</u> culture, and some record of its existence is chronicled in texts from the <U>Classical</U> period, but little remains to analyse today.
				The situation is far worse for the cultures of <U>Lrex</U> and <U>Eho</U>; little of these languages has survived in the <U>Jastu&hyphen;Sevensi</U> language family, and there is no evidence that either culture had developed any form of written script.
				Without direct archæological access to the <U>Sevensi</U> continent, there is little we can learn beyond the bits and pieces that might be reconstructed through reference in early <U>Sevensi</U> historical works.<SUP Id=language.r3><A Href=#language.n3>3</A></SUP>

			<SECTION id=language.history.archaïc>

				<H6>The <U>Archaïc</U> Period</H6>

				<P>	In order to properly understand <U>Classical Sevensi</U>, both as a language and as a culture, it is important to know what preceded it.
					This period, stretching from the invention of <U>Jastulae</U> writing until the development of the earliest recognizable form of what we might classify as <I>Classical</I>, is largely shrouded in mystery—in no small part because hardly any linguistic evidence exists.
					Canonically speaking, texts which precede <U>Classical Sevensi</U> are of dubious authenticity and cannot be treated as primary sources.

				<P>	However, if we grant ourselves access to non&hyphen;canonical records, the earliest known work of <U>Jastu&hyphen;Sevensi</U> origin is the following short excerpt of a work titled <CITE Lang=art-Latn-x-jtl>Pə dätzē āʒo dāʒo</CITE> (<I>The story of the fox</I>):<SUP Id=language.r4><A Href=#language.n4>4</A></SUP>

				<P>	The significance of this text is not clear.
					It appears to date from very early in the <U>Archaïc</U> period, having features from early <U>Jastulae</U> culture, like the <I Lang=art-Latn-x-jtl>&hyphen;l</I> affix denoting pluralization.<SUP Id=language.r6><A Href=#language.n6>6</A></SUP>
					That the text is incomplete is apparent; perhaps it was intended to convey an abstract truth or moral value, but from this small fragment it is impossible to tell what such a message might be.

				<P>	We find in this text several other features indicative of <U>Archaïc</U>&hyphen;period <U>Jastu&hyphen;Sevensi</U> languages: an object&hyphen;verb&hyphen;subject word order, the use of <I Lang=art-Latn-x-jtl>l'</I> to introduce affixes; some of these, such as tense markings, were present only in particular time periods and regions.
					The poëtic nature of the language is somewhat limited; the sentences are simple, the vocabulary basic.
					Nevertheless, the text is able to convey a narrative, clearly of cultural or personal invention, with relative ease, perhaps suggesting that storytelling may have already been an influence on <U>Sevensi</U> culture at this early stage.

			<SECTION Id=language.history.pre-early>

				<H6>The <U>Pre&hyphen;Classical</U> and <U>Early&hyphen;Classical</U> Periods</H6>

				<P>	Strictly speaking, the term <I><U>Classical Sevensi</U></I> can be used to refer to any early form of the <U>Sevensi</U> language after its split from the broad <U>Jastu&hyphen;Sevensi</U> family; in particular, it denotes any iteration of the language after the development of the vowel harmonization structures and subject&hyphen;object&hyphen;verb word&hyphen;order which serve to characterize the language.
					Colloquially, however, <I><U>Classical Sevensi</U></I> generally refers to the language as it was spoken in the <U>Late Classical</U> period—that is, the period in which the early <U>Sevensi</U> <CITE>Classics</CITE> were written.
					This period is preceded by two earlier ones: the <U>Pre&hyphen;Classical</U> and <U>Early&hyphen;Classical</U> periods.

				<P>	The <U>Pre&hyphen;Classical</U> period is the period in which many significant aspects of what we now consider to be <U>Classical Sevensi</U> first begin to take shape.
					In particular, the phonology of the language is normalized into roughly what it will remain as for the entire <U>Classical</U> period, the word&hyphen;order is more&hyphen;or&hyphen;less fixed in stone, and standardized methods of word&hyphen;formation become more firmly established.

				<P>	The <U>Early&hyphen;Classical</U> period sees the establishment of many of the formalized grammatical structures that come to characterize <U>Classical Sevensi</U> as a language, including its complex system of verb conjugation.
					The literary aspects of the language also expand in this period and formalized systems of poëtry become better&hyphen;defined.

	<SECTION Id=structure>

		<H4>Structure of this Textbook</H4>

		<P>	This textbook is divided into three sections.<SUP id=structure.r1><A Href=#structure.n1>1</A></SUP>
			The first, labelled <A Href=Grammar/index.html><CITE>Grammar</CITE></A>, describes in detail the grammatical underpinnings of the <U>Classical Sevensi</U> language.
			At the time of writing, no comprehensive grammar of <U>Classical Sevensi</U> exists, so it will aim for thoroughness over simplicity.
			Students are not expected to read through the entire <A Href=Grammar/index.html><CITE>Grammar</CITE></A> in one sitting, however, but rather will be directed to particular passages as they proceed through their lessons.

		<P>	The second section, labelled <A Href=Lessons/index.html><CITE>Lessons</CITE></A>, contains a number of lessons aimed at teaching <U>Classical Sevensi</U> grammars and vocabulary.
			This should be the starting point for most students, as well as where they spend the bulk of their time.

		<P>	The third section, labelled <A Href=Glossary/index.html><CITE>Glossary</CITE></A>, is an abridged dictionary of the <U>Classical Sevensi</U> language, containing all the words used in the text alongside additional information.
			Much of this information is taken from the public&hyphen;domain data produced by <U>the LANGDEV Project</U>, and page references for information on the usage or conjugation of glossary terms are also provided.

		<SECTION Id=structure.lessons>

			<H5>Lessons</H5>

			<P>	Lessons themselves are comprised of multiple parts.
				A description for each follows:

			<SECTION Id=structure.lessons.text>

				<H6>Text</H6>

				<P>	Each lesson begins with a paragraph of text written entirely in <U>Classical Sevensi</U>.
					By the end of the lesson, students should be able to effectively understand the text and translate it into <U>English</U>.

			</SECTION>

			<SECTION Id=structure.lessons.vocabulary>

				<H6>Vocabulary</H6>

				<P>	Following the text, a short list of vocabulary words for the lesson is provided, along with their definitions.
					Words are classified according to their function in <A Href=Lessons/01.html><CITE>Lesson 1</CITE></A> and <A Href=Lessons/02.html><CITE>2</CITE></A>, and by part of speech in subsequent lessons.
					Both <U>Latin</U> and <U>Sevensi</U> orthographies are provided for all words, but by <A Href=Lessons/03.html><CITE>Lesson 3</CITE></A> students are expected to be able to read and write the <U>Sevensi</U> script.

				<P>	This textbook does not indicate a word's accents in the <CITE>Vocabulary</CITE> sections. <U>Classical Sevensi</U> features a simple pitch&hyphen;accent system, but it is highly flexible and students need not be overly concerned with its specifics.
					Accents have been recorded in the <A Href=Glossary/index.html><CITE>Glossary</CITE></A> for interested students.

			</SECTION>

			<SECTION Id=structure.lessons.usage>

				<H6>Usage Notes</H6>
				<P>	Following the vocabulary, a number of notes clarifying usage are included.

			</SECTION>

			<SECTION Id=structure.lessons.grammar>

				<H6>Grammar</H6>

				<P>	A number of readings from the <A Href=Grammar/index.html><CITE>Grammar</CITE></A> are provided in each lesson.
					Students should familiarize themselves with the basics of these readings as part of the lesson.

			</SECTION>

			<SECTION Id=structure.lessons.practice>

				<H6>Practice</H6>

				<P>	The <CITE>Practice</CITE> section of a lesson gives students an opportunity to test their knowledge of the lesson's contents.
					Practice questions will target both vocabulary and the readings on grammar.

			</SECTION>

			<SECTION Id=structure.lessons.translation>

				<H6>Translation</H6>

				<P>	The final section of a lesson is a short paragraph in <U>English</U> which completes the narrative of the opening <CITE>Text</CITE>.
					Students should be able to translate this paragraph into <U>Classical Sevensi</U> before moving on.

			</SECTION>

		</SECTION>

		<FOOTER Id=structure.notes>

			<DL>

				<DT Id=structure.n1><A Href=#structure.r1>1</A></DT>
				<DD>	The overall layout and structure of this text is largely inspired by Stéfan Einarsson's <CITE>Icelandic: Grammar Texts Glossary</CITE>, which I found to be wonderfully straightforward.

			</DL>

		</FOOTER>

	</SECTION>

	<SECTION Id=orthography>

		<H4>Orthography and Font</H4>

		<P>	<U>Sevensi</U> has its own script, a cursive abjad which is quite unlike the <U>Latin</U> script used by <U>English</U>.
			In <A Href=Lessons/1.html><CITE>Lesson 1</CITE></A> and <A Href=Lessons/2.html><CITE>2</CITE></A>, the initial <CITE>Text</CITE> of the lesson is provided using both scripts.
			From <A Href=Lessons/3.html><CITE>Lesson 3</CITE></A> onward, however, knowledge of the <U>Sevensi</U> script is expected.

		<SECTION Id=orthography.computers>

			<H5>Sevensi and computers</H5>

			<P>	Computer support for the <U>Sevensi</U> script is presently rather lacking:
				It is not officially encoded into <CITE>Unicode</CITE> and font support largely does not exist.
				The <A Href=https://github.com/langdev-project/langdev-unicode Target=_blank><CITE>LANGDEV in Unicode</CITE></A> specification has encoded the <U>Sevensi</U> script into the private&hyphen;use area of <U>Unicode</U>, and <A Href=https://github.com/langdev-project/unifont-langdev Target=_blank><CITE>Unifont LANGDEV</CITE></A> provides minimal font&hyphen;support for these characters.
				Installing this or another <U>Sevensi</U> font is required for the viewing of plain&hyphen;text <U>Sevensi</U> characters in this text.

			<P>	In situations where inputting or providing support for <U>Sevensi</U> text would be overly cumbersome, the <U>Latin</U> romanizations are often used.
				The necessity of being able to read both <U>Latin</U> and <U>Sevensi</U> scripts is one of the reasons both alternatives are provided in the <CITE>Vocabulary</CITE> sections of lessons and the <A Href=Glossary/index.html><CITE>Glossary</CITE></A> in this text.
