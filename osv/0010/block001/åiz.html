    <dt>Etymology:
    <dd>From VIV <i lang="art-Latn-x-osv-0009">*aust</i> <small>«another»</small>.
        In Proto&ndash;Jastu-Sevensi, pluralization was performed by appending the suffix <i lang="art-Latn-x-osv-0009">-l</i> to the end of a noun.
        This was dropped in favour of repurposing the pronoun <i lang="art-Latn-x-osv-0009">*aust</i> as a determiner, whose meaning had by this time shifted from <small>«another»</small> to <small>«some unspecified (other?) group»</small>
