#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI X  #

The first level of evolution and abstraction from JASTU-SEVENSI VIV; in which the grammars are formalized and the phonology is brought better under control.

##  Changes from VIV and previous:  ##

Note that, in CLASSICAL SEVENSI VIV, the second-to-last syllable of the word-root is always stressed.
See also CLASSICAL SEVENSI :: PHONOLOGY for a list of phonological shifts and changes.

###  gramatical gender and nasalization  ###

In JÄSTŪGĀ/JÄSTŪGEI VIII, *aen* was used to indicate feminine connotations in a small subset of words.
These feminine connotations were largely removed in VIV, and the nasalization was detached into a word-final _-\*n_.
CLASSICAL SEVENSI lacks any grammatical gender and this pattern has expanded to other syllables.

###  codas  ###

Syllable codas may now include any letter in the orthography.
Syllable codas are limited to a single letter, with the exception of _l_, which may be followed another in some circumstances.
(This comes from _l_'s original purpose as an affix-separator.)
In word-final compound codas, the second letter is not pronounced.

###  harmonization

Words are now harmonized according to the polarity of their stressed syllable.
Words whose stressed syllable is neutral are not harmonize
