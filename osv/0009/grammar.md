#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI VIV :: GRAMMAR  #

The grammar of CLASSICAL SEVENSI VIV diverges somewhat from that of JÄSTŪGEI VIII.
This document aims to serve as an overview to how sentences are roughly constructed.

##  Parts of speech:  ##

CLASSICAL SEVENSI VIV utilizes the following broad "parts of speech":

-   __The article__ defines a noun phrase.
    Examples of articles in ENGLISH are *a* (indefinite) and *the* (definite).
    CLASSICAL SEVENSI VIV has indefinite and definite articles, as well as a third, proper article.
    The proper article is used to indicate a proper name.

-   __The noun~adjective__ identifies the thing being spoken of, or modifies another noun~adjective

-   __The verb__ describes the relationship between the nouns in a sentence.
    In CLASSICAL SEVENSI VIV, the subject has shifted to the front of the sentence, creating a SVO word-order.

-   __The conjunction__ joins parts of sentences.

-   __The pronoun__ takes the place of a noun phrase.

-   __The postposition__ links adjective and adverb phrases to the phrases they modify.

-   __The verbal__ is a modified verb, in the form of a participle or infinitive.
    Participle function exactly like noun~adjectives.
    Infinitives function like adverb clauses, and may be used, without a coordinating conjunction, anywhere an adverb clause might normally be found.
    Infinitives may also take arguments to clarify their relationship to the sentence.

-   __Classifiers__ are special modifiers which only modify amounts.
    They are required whenever a numeral or quantifier functions nominally in a non-abstract sense; they are *not*, however, required when these function adjectivally.

##  Phrases and dependent clauses:  ##

-   __The noun phrase__ begins with an article and ends with a noun~adjective.
    Between these two, any number of adjective phrases and relative clauses may be placed.
    The head noun~adjective of a noun phrase may be optionally followed by additional noun~adjectives, which function as modifiers.

-   __The adjective phrase__ modifies the head noun~adjective of a noun phrase.
    Adjectives phrases are simply noun phrases, followed by a postposition.

-   __The relative clause__ modifies the head noun~adjective of a noun phrase.
    It differs from an adjective phrase in that it contains a verb and is not terminated by a postposition.
    Missing arguments to the verb may be inferred as the noun~adjective to which the clause is attached.

-   __The adverb phrase__ modifies the verb, or an entire sentence.
    It is formed exactly like an adjective phrase, but is placed at the beginning of the sentence instead of inside of a noun phrase.
    The postpositions used to create adverb phrases are usually different than those used to create adjective phrases.

-   __The adverb clause__ modifies the verb, or an entire sentence.
    It begins with a coordinating conjunction, followed by a subordinate clause.
    It is placed at the end of a sentence.
