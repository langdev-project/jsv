#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI XII :: GRAMMAR II  #

This document defines the Level II grammars for CLASSICAL SEVENSI XII.

##  Adnominals  ##

__Adnominals__ are grammatical objects which modify nominals.
The simplest adnominals are either adjectives or determiners.

```
ADN   =  adjv det            ; adnominals
```

Adnominals are placed inside of nominal phrases, in-between the article and the noun.
They are generally ordered from most-restrictive to least-, and determiners always come before adjectives.

```
NP    =/ [art] *det *adjv noun
```

| Note! |
| ----- |
| Adjectives in CLASSICAL SEVENSI XII are actually verbs functioning as relative clauses&mdash;more on this in GRAMMAR IV. |

##  Adjectival nouns  ##

Some nouns can also function as adjectives.
In these cases, they are placed at the *end* of the nominal phrase, after the head noun.
Generally speaking, some attempt is made to limit the number of adjectival nouns in a sentence.

```
NP    =/ [art] *det *adjv noun *adjn
```

| History |
| ------- |
| Over time, the number of adjectival nouns has decreased, while the number of adjectival verbs has increased. In CLASSICAL SEVENSI XII's ancestor language, PROTO&ndash;JASTU-SEVENSI, nearly all nouns could function in an adjectival capacity. |

##  Serial verbs  ##

A transitive verb may be followed by an intransitive in a verbal phrase.
When this happens, the second argument (object) of the first becomes the first argument (subject) of the second.
This process is called __verb serialization__.

```
VP    =/ SUBJ OBJ verb2 verb1
```
