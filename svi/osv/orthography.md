#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI :: ORTHOGRAPHY  #

There are a variety of orthographical systems for recording Classical Sevensi, all of which are employed to some extent here.
The most common and easiest to read is the Latin transliteration, which preserves the vast majority of features of the consturcted phonology.
Due to the syllabic nature of the language, and its employment of vowel harmony, a Hangul orthographical system exists as well, although it has become less of a perfect fit over time.
The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is, of course, used where explicit phonological transcription is required.

The writing systems actually employed during the construction of Classical Sevensi works were far less precise.
The originary script of Classical Sevensi was a logosyllabary; language reform during the late Classical period led to the adoption of an abjad.
The letters of the Classical Sevensian abjad may sometimes be referred to as *runes*; although the writing system is unrelated to that of the runic alphabets, the letters bear a rough visual resemblance and can appear in similar contexts.

The Classical Sevensian abjad is planned to be specified in the LANGDEV Project private-use block U+101100..U+10111F CLASSICAL SEVENSI RUNES according to the following code descriptions:

- U+101100 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER G
